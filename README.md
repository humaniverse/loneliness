## Overview
A loneliness prescription index for the UK. 
The code and approach for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is based on [an approach developed by the Office for National Statistics' Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/developing-a-loneliness-prescription-index/), which uses GP prescription data to find areas with above-average prescriptions for conditions where loneliness has been shown to be a risk factor: Alzheimer's, depression, hyperternsion, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, anxiety, addiction and insomnia. Currently under active
development.

## Virtual Environments
This project uses `requirements.txt` to manage Python package dependencies. 

Instruction below to create and activate the virtual environment using Python's inbuilt `venv` module:
* Create a new virtual environment:
  - `python -m venv venv_loneliness`
* Activate the virtual environment:
  - Windows: `venv_loneliness\Scripts\activate.bat`
  - Unix: `source venv_loneliness/bin/activate`
* Install the packages:
  - Windows: `pip install -r requirements-win.txt`
  - Unix: `pip install -r requirements-unix.txt`
* Deactivate the virtual environment:
  - `deactivate`
